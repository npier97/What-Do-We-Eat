    summary:
      'This version of the French chicken and vegetable stew from chef Anina Belle Giannini is made with a dry white wine like Chardonnay instead of the traditional red. It is still plenty indulgent, thanks to browned chicken pieces, bacon lardons, and a silky, buttery sauce.',
    instructions: `
      <ul>
        <li>Heat a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add bacon lardons and cook until crispy, then remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Brown them in the rendered bacon fat, then remove from the pot.</li>
        <li>In the same pot, sauté onions, carrots, and garlic until softened.</li>
        <li>Deglaze with white wine (Chardonnay) and let it reduce for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return the chicken and bacon to the pot, then add chicken stock and fresh thyme.</li>
        <li>Cover and simmer for 40 minutes until the chicken is tender.</li>
        <li>Stir in butter for a silky finish. Serve with crusty bread or mashed potatoes.</li>

        <li>In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, mirin, brown sugar, sesame seeds, and grated ginger. Simmer until slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Place salmon fillets on a wire rack over green beans on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Brush the salmon with the teriyaki glaze.</li>
